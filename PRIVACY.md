### Analytics

Service Station currently collects no analytics about your usage of the app or any personal data.

In a future app update, Service Station may beging collecting some aggregate, anonymous statistics. These analytics would be used to measure and improve the app.

### App Sandbox

Service Station is a [sandboxed][app sandbox] application, which prevents the app from accessing unnecessary sensitive resources on your Mac.

In order to display the Service Station menu when right-clicking on items in Finder, Service Station requires you grant access to one or more Finder Locations where the app should function.

Service Station saves, locally, a [security-scoped bookmark][security-scoped bookmark] to each of these locations so that your chosen Finder Locations are persisted when the system restarts.

When launching applications and scripts from the Service Station menu, these security bookmarks give access to the items you right-clicked.
